 <h1>PUNCH,<br />
  OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.</h1>

  <h2>Vol. 152.</h2>

<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>It is rumoured that for his mismanagement of the Mexican affair the
  KAISER has decided to teach Herr ZIMMERMANN a terrible lesson. He is to
  be appointed Food Dictator.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"It is impossible to predict when the War will end," says
  Field-Marshal VON HINDENBERG. Of course this is all nonsense. Many of our
  Military Experts have predicted it more than once.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A French journal is of the opinion that the War will end this year,
  but the Germans are not so pessimistic about it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Everything is going right for us," says the <i>Frankfurter
  Zeitung</i>. We can't speak for everything, but it is quite true as far
  as the British Army is concerned.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Germans waste no time and are already dealing with the Unemployed
  question. The KAISER has decided to give a dinner to Count
  BERNSTORFF.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"In America," says Dr. OTTO FLABE in the <i>Vossische Zeitiung</i>,
  "the swindler and the cheat is a hero." It will be remembered how popular
  Count BERNSTORFF said he had been during his stay there.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Just to show the British Parliament that it can be done, it is
  rumoured that the KAISER is about to grant Home Rule to Mexico.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Prussian Herrenhaus has passed a resolution demanding that the
  Imperial Government should conclude an immediate peace on terms
  consistent with Pan-German ideals, including annexation of Belgium and
  Poland, payment of indemnity by the Allies, etc. The GERMAN CHANCELLOR is
  understood to have replied in effect, "Go and do it yourselves."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Sofia announces that 35,000 Bulgarian geese are to be permitted to go
  to Germany. As in the case of the Bulgarian Fox who went to Vienna, there
  appears to be little likelihood that they will ever return.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>After the bombardment of Margate, says the <i>Evening News</i>,
  rabbits were found dead from fright in their hutches. To avoid the
  suspicion of partisanship our contemporary should have explained that
  they were not at the time in Government employ.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The cost of brown paper is said to have advanced to forty shillings a
  ton, or four times its price in peace time. Its use as a substitute for
  "Havana" tobacco (from which it can often be distinguished only by its
  aroma) is probably responsible for the rise.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Allotment holders have been warned to be on their guard against
  wire-worms, and special constables are keeping a sharp look-out by the
  potato-beds. A still more efficacious method of protection is to enclose
  the allotment with barbed wire-wormless.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Two speakers at a Ramsgate meeting recalled that they were chums
  seventy-three years ago. The touching incident has resulted in a local
  appeal for them to be drafted to the same regiment when their class is
  called up.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Cuckfield Council has appealed to householders not to put broken
  glass in their swill. With all imports of glass-ware cut off, it is felt
  that even our pigs must be required to forgo some of their accustomed
  delicacies.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"The heavy tread of policemen often keeps me awake," said the
  Willesden magistrate. He admits, however, that the darkened streets and
  the absence of parental discipline make it more than ever necessary that
  the Force should put its foot down firmly.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Seagulls in Thanet," says a contemporary, "are coming to the backs of
  houses and sharing crumbs with the sparrows." It is doing no more than
  justice to a much abused bird to point out that the sparrows are also
  sharing crumbs with the seagulls.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It appears from a contemporary gossip-writer that Count PLUNKETT has
  definitely decided not to take his seat in the House of Commons until
  after the War. This will be a relief to the authorities, who had feared
  that the two events might clash.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NOTICE.</h3>

  <p>In order to meet the national need for economy in the consumption of
  paper, the Proprietors of <i>Punch</i> are compelled to reduce the number
  of its pages, but propose that the amount of matter published in
  <i>Punch</i> shall by condensation and compression be maintained and
  even, it is hoped, increased.</p>

  <p>It is further necessary that means should be taken to restrict the
  circulation of <i>Punch</i>, and beginning with this issue its price is
  raised to Sixpence. The Proprietors believe that the public will prefer
  an increase of price to a reduction of matter.</p>

  <p>Readers are urged to place an order with their Newsagent for the
  regular delivery of copies, as <i>Punch</i> may otherwise be
  unobtainable, the shortage of paper making imperative the withdrawal from
  Newsagents of the "on-sale-or-return" privilege.</p>

  <p>In consequence of the increase in the price of <i>Punch</i> the period
  covered by subscriptions already paid direct to the <i>Punch</i> Office
  will be proportionately shortened; or the unexpired value will be
  refunded, if desired.</p>

<hr />

  <p>The House of Commons Appeal Tribunal has just granted a brief
  exemption to an importer of Chinese eggs, which are used, it was
  explained, by bakers and for leather tanning. The bakers are believed to
  use them for dressing the surfaces of penny buns.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The North Somerset Liberal Association have passed a resolution asking
  Mr. JOSEPH KING not to offer himself as a candidate at the next election,
  and it is thought likely that Mr. KING will ask his constituents to
  resign.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Llanelly correspondent writes to a morning paper to say that a
  parrot which he had kept for twenty years had just died. But surely the
  remarkable thing is that it didn't die before.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"No one admits taking drink because they like it," said Mr. D'EYNCOURT
  the other day. The popular idea is, of course, that the beastly stuff
  must be got rid of somehow.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Broadstairs Council has been offered six pounds for a sand-artist's
  pitch. The advance in price is attributed to the growing attraction of
  the place for foreigners on a flying visit.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Women will not undertake to rock a cradle after learning to drive a
  van," says Father Vaughan. But we trust they will still handle the baby
  ribbons.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mr. EDWARD BACKHOUSE, the Stockton-on-Tees Peace candidate, is
  reported to have had his first public meeting broken up. He is now of the
  opinion that it serves us right if the War goes on for the present.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Kent rat and sparrow clubs are offering one shilling a dozen for rats'
  tails. The price is small, but, as the President of a leading club points
  out, the vendor is permitted to retain the balance of the rat for his own
  purposes.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Some exception has been taken to Mr. H.W. FORSTER'S statement to the
  House of Commons that only 250,000,000 sandbags have been used by the
  Army in the current year. Several privates home on leave have assured us
  that they themselves have filled at least that number while waiting for a
  single counterattack.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Scottish allotment holder, in the course of digging the other day,
  discovered three sovereigns, a silver watch and a gold ring. Since this
  discovery the authorities have been so overwhelmed by applications for
  allotments that there is some talk of extending the Scottish boundary
  into England, in order to cope with the business.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"It is essential," says Mr. NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN, "that there should be
  some light entertainment and amusement for the people." Several London
  magistrates have promised to be funnier.</p>

<h2>A NATIONAL SKY-SCRAPER.</h2>

  <p>I have been often asked why the Government, foreseeing the inevitable
  increase of Departments, had not the elementary imagination to build a
  colossal sky-scraper to accommodate them all.</p>

  <p>The objections to such an act of apparently obvious intelligence may
  be briefly enumerated.</p>

  <p>(1) With such a landmark whoever had business to conduct with a
  Government Department would know where to find it, for which reason alone
  the system of huts and hotels is to be preferred. The hotels are widely
  scattered and the huts hidden away in odd corners of public gardens and
  parks, and even in the bed of a lake. By the use of motor-cars (petrol
  being for official and not for private consumption) such co-operation as
  cannot be avoided between Departments is assured.</p>

  <p>(2) Even in a single Department too close co-operation is not
  desirable. An hotel, divided into hundreds of small rooms and flats,
  enables the occupant of each room to be isolated, and each self-contained
  flat to have almost the status of a sub-department. Thus the vexatious
  supervision, the easy intercourse and rapid decision which are so
  disturbing to official routine are avoided.</p>

  <p>(3) The express elevators, by which the visitor is shot up to the
  higher storeys of a sky-scraper, would suggest a certain directness and
  celerity in official methods that is calculated to arouse false
  hopes.</p>

  <p>(4) With many or all Departments in one building there would be the
  temptation to place the entire clerical staff under Mr. Neville
  Chamberlain as Director-General, who would transfer them from one office
  to another according to the necessities of each day's work. Such mobility
  would be unpopular, while the inevitable creation of a central
  Press-Bureau, Publicity and Information Department would afford the Press
  a satisfaction that it has done nothing to deserve.</p>

  <p>(5) On the top floor of a sky-scraper is usually a luncheon-club; here
  the various Ministers would meet daily, and could only with difficulty
  escape the exchange of ideas.</p>

  <p>(6) If all Government offices were in a single building the PRIME
  MINISTER could make daily visits to each, and would find it hard to avoid
  comparison between the organization and methods of his various
  Ministers.</p>

  <p>These considerations alone finally dispose of any merits which the
  plan for a national sky-scraper may seem superficially to possess.</p>

<h2>ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h2>

  <p>"SCRUTATOR TEMPORIS ACTI."&mdash;You are not the only one who holds
  that Parliament could not be better or more patriotically occupied at the
  present stage of the War than in devoting their energies to a discussion
  of the Report of the Dardanelles Commission and the detailed evidence on
  which it was based. We understand that your view is shared by all the
  keenest patriots among the Central Powers.</p>

  <p>"TUBER CAIN."&mdash;The earliest poet to sing of rationing was WILLIAM
  MORRIS, who repeatedly described himself as "The idle singer of an empty
  day."</p>

  <p>"A LOVER OF 'BUSTER BROWN.'"&mdash;We gladly gave publicity to your
  indignant denial of any tribal relationship between "Buster Brown" and
  Filibuster STONE.</p>

<h3>"THE SPECTATOR" AND "THE TRADE."</h3>

<p class="center">A PAINFUL RUMOUR.</p>

  <p>Last week one of our representatives had the honour of calling at the
  offices of <i>The Spectator</i> to inquire into the credibility of
  certain strange rumours that have recently been current in The Trade.
  They were to the effect that Mr. ST. LOE STRACHEY, Editor of <i>The
  Spectator</i>, having gallantly volunteered under the National Service
  Scheme, had had allotted to him, by one of the DIRECTOR-GENERAL'S
  subordinates, a post of national importance at Messrs. Bassopp's Brewery.
  Mr. STRACHEY'S fertile and forcible pen was (so the rumour went) to be
  employed by this firm in the drawing up of some pungent advertisements
  under the headings, "The Weakness of the Water Movement," "Up, Glasses!"
  etc., including a verse series, in Horatian alcoholics, entitled, "Bonnie
  D.T."</p>

  <p>It was reported that in the ironic circumstances in which he found
  himself, Mr. STRACHEY felt it his duty to acquiesce loyally in the change
  of view imposed upon him, and to adopt a policy of "Down,
  Spectators!"</p>

  <p>Our representative is happy to state that he has the highest authority
  for giving an unqualified denial to these sinister allegations.</p>

<h2>THE EVERLASTING ROMANCE.</h2>

  <p>The other day I did a perfectly dreadful thing: I intruded, all
  unconsciously but in the most blundering way, on a love scene. It was in
  the National Gallery, long famous as the meeting-place of affinities, in
  the big room where the pictures lent by the Duke of WESTMINSTER and the
  Duke of BUCCLEUCH are now hanging, and before I knew it I found myself
  standing between two young people whose eyes were fixed on each other.
  Naturally I moved away at once, but later I returned and made so bold as
  to study them a little, for it was clearly, if not yet a passion, a
  mutual interest of such tender depths that no outsider could affect
  it.</p>

  <p>The boy&mdash;for he was no more&mdash;was one of the most beautiful
  that I have ever seen. His hair was perhaps a thought longer than we
  encourage to-day, but one always sees odd people in the National Gallery,
  where artists&mdash;most careless of men&mdash;are now constant visitors,
  drawn there by the many new pictures, and especially, perhaps, the modern
  French examples from Sir HUGH LANE'S collection. His hair was the more
  noticeable because he carried his hat in his hand; his clothes were
  noticeable too, being a shade too fanciful for London in winter&mdash;but
  then, who cares how people dress in London? I am sure I don't; and
  especially so when they have such eyes as this boy's, dark and rich, and
  such a curve to such lips.</p>

  <p>There he stood, perfectly still, his steady gaze fixed on the lady
  opposite, while she in her turn never wavered in her gaze upon him. But
  whereas there was something bold in his homage there was a half-shy way
  with her. He was facing her squarely, but she looked at him a little
  sideways, and a little curiously, in demure dubiousness. One could see
  that she was enormously intrigued, but her interest was not expressed by
  any movement. In fact neither moved; they remained some twenty yards
  apart all the time I observed them: each, I suppose, leaving it to the
  other&mdash;the boy because he was so young, the girl because she was
  already woman, and woman likes to force advances from man.</p>

  <p>I never saw a prettier thing than the little lady, with her cool white
  skin, and the faintest flush on her cheeks, and her eyes not less dark
  than the boy's but lacking the sensitive depths of his.</p>

  <p>The odd thing was that, although they were so engrossed each in the
  other, both, I observed, looked also at me. It struck me as not the least
  strange part of this charming drama that its hero and heroine, while
  completely absorbed in their own sympathetic relationship, should be able
  to turn a calm survey upon a stranger too. This gift made them the more
  memorable and perhaps explains why, for all the rest of the day and at
  intervals in the night and morning following, I thought of these young
  people, speculating as to how they were getting on; and perhaps that is
  why, the next afternoon, drawn by invisible wires, I found myself in the
  National Gallery again.</p>

  <p>Will you believe it?&mdash;they also were there. This is an absolute
  fact. There they were, exactly as I had left them. And yet, not exactly,
  for I am certain that there was a hint more of seriousness in the lady's
  glance and a shade more troubled earnestness in his. But as regards
  actual distance, they were still as far apart, although certainly nearer
  in spirit.</p>

  <p>Curiosity as to names is a foible which should be, I am convinced,
  discouraged; but on this occasion I could not resist the desire to know
  more of such assiduous habitués. Drawing one of the attendants aside, I
  asked him if he could tell who these romantic young things were. "To be
  sure," he said. "The young gentleman is 'The Blue Boy,' by GAINSBOROUGH,
  and the young lady is the Lady ELIZABETH MONTAGU, by REYNOLDS."</p>

  <p>Only portraits after all, you say. But don't be too hasty. Go rather
  to the National Gallery and see for yourself. Maybe you will then realise
  that there is more there than paint....</p>

  <p>Shallow people talk about accidents. But the wise know that accidents
  do not happen. The wise know that the War broke out in order that
  Grosvenor House, where "The Blue Boy" normally resides, and Montagu
  House, the home of this little Buccleuch lady with skin like an anemone,
  might be needed for War-work, so that when the pictures were sent to the
  National Gallery for safer keeping these two might be placed opposite
  each other in the same room. Chance? The only chance is destiny.</p>

<h3><i>MON SOLDAT ET MON CURÉ.</i></h3>

  <p>"Donne un peu, Maman, s'il te plaît," said Jeanne eagerly.</p>

  <p>Maman handed over the newspaper from which she had just read aloud and
  explained the passage so full of touching interest to them both, and
  Jeanne, with help at the difficult places, read out:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>"'CITATIONS À L'ORDRE DU JOUR.</i></p>

  <p><i>Jacques Martin, soldat au 170e d'infanterie, grenadier d'élite, au
  cours des combats du 26 et du 27 novembre, 1916, a, par son mépris du
  danger et par son ardeur, assuré la progression dans un boyau défendu pas
  à pas par l'ennemi.</i></p>

  <p><i>Le soldat Jacques Martin est Monsieur l'abbé Martin, curé de
  &mdash;&mdash;.'</i></p>

  <p>"Oui, nous savons bien d'où il est curé!" cried Jeanne, in admiration
  and awe. "C'est bien beau, hein, Maman?" Then suddenly she became silent
  and thoughtful, remembering the subsequent fate of her friend and
  hero.</p>

  <p>"Dire qu'il est maintenant prisonnier en Alle... en Bochie!" she said.
  They had known long ago that he was mentioned in despatches, and they had
  been on the look-out for the glorious details in print, but only this
  morning had they heard of his capture.</p>

  <p>How proud they were of their gentle curé and brave soldier! Jeanne had
  at first been greatly perplexed by the strange dual personality, with its
  incompatibilities, and many were the questions that had arisen in her
  active little mind. "Le curé de Suzanne, c'est autre chose," she
  reflected, for though technically a soldier was he not a
  <i>brancardier</i> rescuing the wounded? Her own practical conclusions,
  however, and the answers to her questions smoothed away many
  difficulties, and perfect faith in her friend did the rest.</p>

  <p>Still she had never been able quite to merge the <i>religieux</i> and
  the <i>poilu</i> into one picture; besides, she liked to play with the
  idea and confront the one with the other. "Que va dire Monsieur le curé
  lorsque le soldat tuera un homme?" And she had slipped into the habit of
  calling him "Mon soldat et mon curé," suddenly inspired to adapt the
  title of Cousin Juliette's absorbing book, <i>Mon Oncle et mon Curé</i>,
  and she refused to abandon it when told that they were two separate
  persons. For that matter so were the <i>soldat</i> and the
  <i>curé</i>.</p>

  <p>"Maman, nous allons tout de suite préparer son paquet de conforts,"
  urged Jeanne. And, thinking out what comforts had best be included in the
  parcel, her mind went off now in one channel, now in another, as she
  pictured the priest or the <i>piou-piou</i>. The latter presented no
  difficulty&mdash;for him good things to eat were the first
  necessity&mdash;but the <i>curé</i> would require spiritual comforts.</p>

  <p>"Des livres de messe," she said to herself; and thereupon the image of
  the cold and hungry soldier arose before her, and "un poulet ou un bon
  bifteck!" she added. Then, her eye lighting upon an advertisement in the
  newspaper before her, "Maman, que veut dire por-ta-tif?" she asked. The
  explanation received, she clapped her hands with joy; yes, surely a
  <i>portable</i> one was the very thing! "Maman, si nous envoyions à mon
  curé un autel por-ta-tif?"</p>

  <p>But Maman thought that, all things considered, it would be better to
  send only food in the first parcel. So Jeanne reconciled herself to the
  idea, although the <i>curé</i> still remained a shadowy figure in the
  background with his own especial need.</p>

  <p>And prisoners were cold as well as hungry. What a pity something
  <i>hot</i> could not be sent.</p>

  <p>"Tiens! J'y suis!" cried Jeanne. "Ô Maman, j'ai une si bonne idee! Si
  nous envoyions un bon repas bien chaud dans <i>l'auto-cuiseur!</i>"
  Perhaps it would keep hot for a day or two. <i>How</i> long did it take
  for a parcel to reach <i>Bochie?</i></p>

  <p>But Maman decided this plan could not be risked; there was often
  delay, and the moist food might turn sour.</p>

  <p>A little chilled but nowise daunted, for she was sure the hay-box
  would come in somehow, Jeanne remained for some time plunged deep in
  thought. Then came light and her face grew radiant. Why not send the
  <i>auto-cuiseur</i> filled with dry food? <i>Les Boches</i> would surely
  give, or sell, some boiling water and let him just start cooking on their
  stove. And he would be able to use the cooker constantly, buying <i>des
  choses pas chères</i> to cook; and yes, why not slip into the package a
  copy of <i>Plats économiques</i>, the little cookery book whose recipes
  they had found so satisfactory?</p>

  <p>"Et mon curé?" But now the two figures merged more nearly than ever
  before into one, and Jeanne felt that <i>his</i> first need was one with
  that of the soldier, and the <i>marmite</i> would hold enough for
  both.</p>

  <p>"Mais <i>oui</i>," she exclaimed, "c'est cela!... Écoute, Maman!
  Envoyons l'auto-cuiseur <i>aux deux</i>... Ne vois-tu pas que mon soldat
  pourra alors manger tous les jours un bon repas bien chaud, et que mon
  curé pourra en donner aux autres affamés? C'est là tout juste l'affaire
  d'un curé. L'auto-cuiseur est comme ça deux cadeaux en un, comme mon
  soldat et mon curé sont deux hommes en un!"</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

  <p><i>Monday, March 5th.</i>&mdash;General cheers greeted Mr.
  CHAMBERLAIN'S announcement that the Government of India had undertaken to
  pay the interest on a hundred millions of war-debt, but when he proceeded
  to say that part of the new revenue required would be obtained by an
  increase in the cotton duties there was a notable cooling of enthusiasm
  among Members from Lancashire. Mr. RUNCIMAN at once sounded the alarm on
  behalf of Manchester by asking if there would be a corresponding excise
  duty on Indian cottons. "All India is against it," replied Mr.
  CHAMBERLAIN, who is finding, as his father did before him, how difficult
  it is to get Englishmen to "think imperially" where their own particular
  trade is concerned.</p>

  <p>There is no doubt that the FOOD CONTROLLER possesses a sense of
  judicial humour. Complaints have been made of late that while the
  ordinary British citizen was expected to confine himself to four pounds
  of bread per week the pampered German prisoner, instead of getting less,
  was given nearly three times that amount. Lord DEVONPORT has now approved
  a new dietary scale for prisoners, under which the bread ration will be
  cut down to sixty-three ounces, or just one ounce less than the allowance
  of the free and independent Englishman. On the Army Estimates Mr. PRINGLE
  attacked the Salonika Expedition with a vigour which must have greatly
  pleased the Bulgar. By a curious lapse of memory, as Mr. CHURCHILL
  pointed out, he omitted all reference to the position of M. VENIZELOS and
  our honourable obligations to our Allies.</p>

  <p>Mr. CHURCHILL was indeed more statesmanlike than he has been of late,
  His "amphibious intervention" was on this occasion quite justified. There
  was good sense in his warning that, while perseverance towards a definite
  objective was a virtue, "perseverance with an eye on the past" was an
  equally serious vice; and I hope it signifies a determination on his part
  not to allow his brilliant future to be all behind him.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, March 6th.</i>&mdash;Ever since the War began, Mr. SWIFT
  MACNEILL'S most cherished ambition&mdash;second, of course, to his desire
  to quit Westminster for College Green&mdash;has been to get the Dukes of
  CUMBERLAND and SAXE-COBURG deprived of their British titles. He has
  worried three successive Governments on the subject, and some time ago
  received a definite promise that it should be dealt with. A further
  question regarding it stood in his name to-day, but when he rose to put
  it Mr. GINNELL squeaked out, "May I ask you, Mr. SPEAKER, what this House
  has to do with these family matters?" Mr. MACNEILL, of course, like most
  of his countrymen, has royal blood in his veins, but nevertheless did not
  seem pleased with the allusion.</p>

  <p>Further protests against the mutilation of the Dardanelles Report were
  made by Sir WALTER ESSEX, Sir CHARLES HOBHOUSE, and Sir JOHN JARDINE.
  Free disclosure to all Members of Parliament, and no preferential
  treatment of party-leaders, was their demand. Mr. BONAR LAW manfully
  resisted their assaults, and the SPEAKER declined to accept a motion for
  the adjournment. A word from Mr. ASQUITH would no doubt have quelled the
  storm, but as one of the favoured few who are to receive the full Report
  he felt himself, I suppose, precluded from saying it. The late Mr.
  LABOUCHERE would probably have suggested that the difficulty should be
  solved, on the analogy of a famous edition of MARTIAL, by issuing the
  Report as expurgated, together with an appendix containing all the
  omitted passages. But there is no LABOUCHERE in the House
  to-day&mdash;more's the pity.</p>

  <p>What Mr. HOGGE does not know about pensions is not worth knowing. He
  has already made havoc of more than one Government scheme, and unless he
  has an official ring put in his nose he will evidently do his best to
  upset the latest of them. On the whole, however, Mr. BARNES'S exposition
  of the new pension scheme was well received. Though not unduly
  generous&mdash;that would be impossible in the circumstances&mdash;it
  will at least, as Capt. STEPHEN GWYNN put it, "enable us to look disabled
  men in the face."</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, March 7th.</i>&mdash;Lords SHEFFIELD and PARMOOR are
  much disturbed because British subjects have been interned without trial,
  and had to be reminded by the LORD CHANCELLOR that there was a war in
  progress, and that it was better that individuals should lose a portion
  of their liberties than that the community should lose them
  altogether.</p>

  <p>A full appreciation of this truth might have prevented the Irish
  Nationalists from seeking at this moment to get Home Rule out of cold
  storage. If the attempt had to be made Mr. T.P. O'CONNOR was not perhaps
  the best person to make it. For over an hour he meandered through the
  more melancholy episodes of Irish history, from the Treaty of Limerick to
  the Easter Monday rebellion, rather in the manner of one of those
  film-dramas of which he is now the Censor. I am afraid his endeavour to
  prove that Ireland is not "an irrational country, demanding impossible
  things," was not entirely convincing.</p>

  <p>It failed, at any rate&mdash;although backed by a brief appeal by
  Major WILLIE REDMOND, which touched the House by its manifest
  sincerity&mdash;to convince the PRIME MINISTER that this was the accepted
  time for plunging Ireland once more into civil strife. Those parts of
  Ireland that wanted Home Rule could have it to-morrow if they wished;
  neither he nor any other British statesman would force the people of N.E.
  Ulster under a government they disliked. When those two facts were
  thoroughly understood there might be a chance of a settlement.</p>

  <p>Mr. JOHN REDMOND, refusing to continue what he regarded as a futile
  and humiliating debate, marched out of the House at the head of his
  supporters. This manoeuvre, rather effective in the Gladstonian era, did
  not much impress the House on this occasion; for news that something of
  the kind was intended had leaked out; and Mr. HEALY'S subsequent allusion
  to it as "a dramatic skedaddle" was felt to be justified.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, March 8th.</i>&mdash;I should have thought that the
  Dardanelles Report, which everyone is reading, contained enough
  sensations to satisfy the most <i>outrée</i> taste. But Sir CHARLES
  HOBHOUSE is still anxious to know the real meaning of the tantalizing
  asterisks which occur here and there in it, and wants a day to discuss
  the matter. Mr. BONAR LAW did not absolutely refuse, but hoped that when
  his right hon. friend had examined the Report he would forgo his desire
  for further information. It may safely be said that the omitted passages,
  whatever they are, could hardly alter the public verdict on the
  extraordinary notions of conducting a war which seem to have prevailed in
  the Cabinet of which Sir CHARLES HOBHOUSE was himself a member.</p>

  <p>The determining factor in the inception of the Dardanelles affair
  seems to have been the disastrous confidence of the then First Lord of
  the Admiralty in the 15-inch guns of the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>. The
  outcome recalls a verse from a song popular when Master WINSTON was in

<h3>CHILDREN'S TALES FOR GROWN-UPS.</h3>

<p class="center">II.</p>

<p class="center">BELLING THE CAT.</p>

  <p>"The only question is," said the old mouse, "who is to bell the
  cat?"</p>

  <p>"An absurd question," said the strategist.</p>

  <p>"It has finished the story for hundreds of years," said the old mouse
  crossly.</p>

  <p>The strategist turned his back on the old mouse. "What is needed," he
  said, "is a plan. We must make the cat appear ridiculous, and the people
  of the house will see it is no use as a mouser. Then they will turn it
  into a pet cat and bell it themselves."</p>

  <p>"Shall we send a deputation?" growled the old mouse.</p>

  <p>"We must go out and hunt for food in the daytime," said the
  strategist.</p>

  <p>"We shall all be killed," cried the mice, shivering with terror.</p>

  <p>"No more than are killed now," said the strategist. "Less, in fact,
  because cats do not see so well in the daytime."</p>

  <p>And it turned out as the strategist predicted. Mice ran about boldly
  everywhere, and though the cat caught some of them the people of the
  house were dissatisfied. "We might as well drown that cat at once and get
  a real mouser," said the master.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't drown poor pussy," said the little girl. "Do let me keep
  her."</p>

  <p>"Well, mind you put a bell round her neck, then," laughed the master
  of the house, "so that she may know that she's not a real mouser."</p>

  <p>That night there was joy unheard of among the mice. They scampered
  about happily, and ran away chuckling when pussy came tinkling along. The
  strategist was crowned king.</p>

  <p>Next day the real mouser arrived. His first victim was the
  strategist.</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p class="center">"THE MAN WHO WENT ABROAD."</p>

  <p>The authors of <i>The Man Who Stayed at Home</i> (I preserve their
  modest anonymity) have contrived a sequel to that exciting and veracious
  stage account of secret service activities. <i>The Man Who Went
  Abroad</i> on one of those famous State-paper chases, in which
  conspirators conspire in the least likely places, such as the promenade
  decks of liners, is the man who spent his time in chimneys at home in the
  earlier part of the War&mdash;<i>Kit Brent</i>.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:33%;">
      <a href="images/174b.png"><img width="100%" src="images/174b.png"
      alt="" /></a>
    <p>THE MAN WHO STAYED IN HIS TENT.</p>

    <p><i>Christopher Brent.</i> MR. KENNETH DOUGLAS.</p>

    <p><i>Ani Kiraly.</i> MISS IRIS HOEY.</p>
  </div>
  <p>He had a cousin, <i>Lord Goring</i>, Cabinet Minister, bound on a
  mission to Washington; and <i>Kit</i>, who was as like his cousin as
  clean-shaven KENNETH DOUGLAS was like KENNETH DOUGLAS with a toothbrush
  moustache, took his cabin while the important peer preceded him in
  another boat. On board <i>Kit</i> disports himself as a fatuous ass, of
  the kind that hyphenated Americans (in plays) would naturally assume to
  be the staple of a British Cabinet. Not that <i>Goring</i> really was
  such an ass; but it was <i>Kit's</i> plan to be so guileless as to induce
  the enemy agents to think they had a sitter. And I must say they were
  pretty easily induced. Their general schema was to get those inevitable
  papers, copy and return them, and delay <i>Goring's</i> visit to
  Washington, while the late lamented BERNSTORFF put in a suggestion which
  would make the British schemes, whatever they were&mdash;it was secret
  service, so we, rightly, never knew&mdash;look foolish. And they had the
  Hunnish idea of compromising the silly peer with an irresistible Austrian
  <i>danseuse (Ani Kiraly)</i>, so that fear of exposure (by Hidden-Hand
  Press) of intrigue with enemy aliens would make him hand over the
  "papers." <i>Brent</i> played up to all this. But the lady of the ballet
  fell really in love with him, and besides was actually a Dalmatian and on
  the right side, a fact which she proclaimed at the top of her voice on
  the promenade dock, though, as she added, it meant death if discovered.
  In New York the <i>Kiraly</i> appears in <i>Kit's</i> bed-bathroom in the
  early morning, for devilment; to our loud enjoyment, for the great bath
  joke has an assured immortality. The <i>Kiraly's</i> husband appears too.
  Fat in fire. When <i>Kit</i> goes to the hyphenated's flat to exchange
  fake papers in his belt for letter acknowledging <i>Kiraly's</i>
  innocence, an agitated Hun appears with the news that the real
  <i>Goring</i> is in Washington, and the papers all spoof; which was
  annoying, as a reading-glass had already disclosed to the chief spy the
  British Government watermark, which obviously proved they were
  genuine.</p>

  <p>Nothing for it but to clear out (through a portrait of the
  All-Highest), leaving <i>Kit</i> in the safe to suffocate. Enter police
  (comic). Where is <i>Kit?</i> Brain-wave. In the safe, behind secret
  panel. Problem: how to open it. The service was evidently so secret that
  it had never told one of its brightest young men about combination
  letter-locks. But the dancer remembers that the chief spy had carefully
  explained to her the letters of the combination. Release of <i>Kit</i>
  and a curtain which suggested that the initiative remained with the
  <i>Kiraly</i>.</p>

  <p>The authors are to be congratulated. They provided a good
  unpretentious evening's entertainment. No dull and pedantic realism for
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg 175]</span>
  them. The dialogue was bright, occasionally to the sparkling point. The
  players were competent and zealous. Mr. KENNETH DOUGLAS gave the right
  variety to his three parts, <i>Goring</i> as he was, <i>Goring</i> as he
  was assumed to be for purpose of bluffing the enemy, and <i>Kit
  Brent</i>; and he played his great bathroom scene with humour and
  complete discretion. Miss IRIS HOEY was a charming innocent adventuress
  with heart of gold and eye of gladness; Mr. HIGNETT, as <i>Kit's</i>
  self-possessed man <i>Cosens</i>, quite admirable, with just the right
  mixture of friendliness without impertinence and restraint without
  servility. Mr. WENMAN as a superabundant gum-chewing impresario, and Mr.
  EILLE NORWOOD as head villain, were quite plausible in the interesting
  and unlikely situation. I must say I like this kind of nonsense
  immensely.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p><i>Zella Sees Herself</i> (HEINEMANN) is an unusual and very subtle
  analysis of a single character. The author, E.M. DELAFIELD, has made an
  almost uncannily penetrating study of the development of a
  <i>poseuse</i>. <i>Zella</i> posed instinctively, from the days when as a
  child she alienated her father by attitudinising (with the best
  intentions) about her mother's funeral. It became a habit with her. In
  Rome, before the Arch of Titus, she thought more of what she might
  acceptably say about it than of any wonder or beauty in the thing itself.
  She fooled the honest man who imagined he was in love with her by making
  herself, for the time, just what her fatal facility for such perception
  told her he would most like her to be. The skill of the book is proved by
  the increasing anxiety, and even agitation, with which one awaits the
  moment that shall fulfil the title. It comes, bringing with it that
  almost intolerable tragedy of the soul, the black loneliness that waits
  upon insincerity. Then poor deluded <i>Zella</i>, seeing herself, sees
  also the fate that eventually befalls those who have deliberately
  falsified the signals by which alone one human heart can speak to and
  assist another. That is all the plot of the story, told with remarkable
  insight and a care that is both sympathetic and wholly unsparing. I am
  mistaken if you will not find it one of the most absorbing within recent
  experience. But I am not saying that it may not leave you just a little
  uncomfortable.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>BOYD CABLE is already one of the prose Laureates of the War, having
  earned his wreath by <i>Between the Lines</i> and <i>Action Front</i>. He
  now proves that he is still entitled to it by <i>Grapes of Wrath</i>
  (SMITH, ELDER). The two former books gave us detached articles all
  relating to the one great subject. The present book is a continuous
  story, the episodes of which are held together by the deeds and
  characters of a quartette of friends, <i>Larry Arundel</i>, <i>Billy
  Simson</i>, <i>Pug Sneath</i>, and the noble and adventurous American,
  <i>Kentucky Lee</i>, who had enlisted in our Army to prove that "too
  proud to fight" was a phrase which did not agree with the traditions of
  an old Kentucky family. These four and the rest of the regiment, the
  Stonewalls, are plunged into one of the big "pushes" of the British Army,
  and their achievements in one form or another are thick on every page of
  the book. The author has reduced the description of a modern battle to a
  fine art. No one can describe more vividly the noise, the squalor, the
  terror, the high courage, the self-sacrifice and again the
  nerve-shattering noise, that go to make up the fierce confusion of
  trench-fighting. How anyone succeeds in surviving when so many
  instruments are used for his destruction is a mystery. The book is very
  certainly one to be read and re-read.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Separation</i> (CASSELL) is another of those intimate studies of
  Anglo-Indian life that ALICE PERRIN has made specially her own. The
  tragedy of it is sufficiently conveyed by the title. Separation, of
  husband from wife or parent from child, is of course the spectre that
  haunts the Anglo-Indian home. It was, chiefly at least, for the health of
  their child <i>Winnie</i> that <i>Guy Bassett</i> was forced to let her
  and his wife abide permanently in Kensington while he himself continued
  his Eastern career as a grass-widower. Very naturally, the result was all
  sorts of trouble. This first took the form of a flirtation, only half
  serious, with an artful young woman of the type with which Mr. KIPLING
  has made us familiar. Unfortunately poor <i>Bassett</i> escapes from this
  emotional frying-pan only to plunge into the fire of a much more
  scorching attachment. But I will not spoil for you an ingenious plot. For
  one thing at least the book is worth reading, and that is the picture,
  admirably drawn, of the half-caste <i>Orchard</i> family, whose ways and
  speech and general outlook you will find an abiding joy. Mrs. PERRIN has
  nothing better in her whole gallery, which is saying much.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>You probably know Mr. BLACKWOOD'S elusive method of mystery-mongering
  by now. None of his characters can ever <i>quite</i> make out whether the
  latest noise is a mewing cat, the wind in the trees or the Great God Pan
  flirting with the Hamadryads. He meets in Egypt a Russian, consumptive
  with a hooked nose and a rotten bad temper, and persists in seeing him as
  a hawk-man dedicated to the wingéd god, Horus. "No one could say exactly
  what happened." (They never can.) But it was something very solemn and
  important, and in the end the Russian, in a fancy dress of feathers, was
  found dead at the foot of the cliff, whither he had flown (or was it
  danced?&mdash;well, no one quite knew). He all but carried with him
  little golden-haired <i>Vera</i>, who was all but a dove. This is a quite
  characteristic sample out of <i>Day and Night Stories</i> (CASSELL). And
  the conclusion I came to was that Mr. BLACKWOOD must get a lot of fun out
  of staying in "cosmopolitan hotels." You need a special attitude for the
  proper enjoyment of these mystical yarns. I read them all conscientiously
  through, and I got far the best thrill out of "The Occupant of the Room,"
  which, attempting less, was much more successful. "H.S.H.," His Satanic
  Majesty, of course, who was climbing the Devil's Saddle and turned in to
  the Club hut for desultory conversation about his lost kingdom with a
  stranded mountaineer, left me inappropriately cold. I suppose I am
  immune, a bad subject: but I feel as sure as I've felt about anything in
  the realm of light letters that a charming writer is overworking an
  unprofitable vein.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Mrs. Vernon's Daughter</i> (METHUEN) is what one might call a story
  of situation. That is to say, it leads up to, and declines from, one big
  <i>scène à faire</i>. The scene, in this instance, is that in which
  <i>Demaris</i>, who has always previously imagined her mother to be an
  undervalued heroine, finds that on the contrary she is really no better
  (indeed a good deal worse) than she should be. And as if this disillusion
  were not enough the poor girl gets almost simultaneously the further
  shock of learning that the same adored parent, supposed by her to be a
  tragédienne of the first water, is in fact no more than a handsome stick,
  and unable (as they say) to act for nuts. Jesting apart, I am bound to
  admit that Lady TROUBRIDGE has risen admirably to the demands of her
  theme, and written a story both direct and appealing. Perhaps (dare I
  say?) its emotion is rather more secure than its grammar. The fact that
  she makes a duchess allude to "these kind of things" struck me at first
  as a subtlety of characterization, till I discovered that, some pages
  later, the author fell herself into the identical pit. But I suppose
  there is hardly any one of us wholly innocent of this offence; anyhow, it
  is only a small blemish upon a pleasant and (in its mild way) interesting
  story.</p>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
